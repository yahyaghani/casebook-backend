However, before recording her testimony the learned Judge of the Trial Court had asked the victim a number of questions to establish whether she was competent to testify and had recorded that, she was \quite mature and has answered the questions above satisfactorily, hence she is declared a competent witness\. Thereafter, the victim (PW-3) testified on oath that she had been raped and she was cross-examined at length by the petitioner\s counsel yet no material contradiction emerged nor did she resile from the accusation she had made against the petitioner. The victim proved a reliable witness and was physically examined by two lady doctors. Firstly, by Dr. Shabanna Tabbasum (PW-1) on 30 March 2008 who had amongst other things noted that the victim\s \Perineum, vulva stained with blood\, \deep penetration had been tried\, \Patient was still bleeding, \Hymen shows fresh tear at 6\clock\ and, on the basis of the examination of the victim had rendered her opinion that the probable duration of injuries was within twelve hours. She also took a vaginal swab for chemical examination to ascertain the presence of semen."
